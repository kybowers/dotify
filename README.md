A music data export tool built with Electron and React.

Development will be sporadic. 

To run development: `yarn electron-dev`

To build portable app: `yarn electron-pack`

Planned features and known defects:

- Auth token need to be stored somewhere secure and semi-persistant
- File export should have more options for saving
- Home/Login page should be more presentable
- Smooth animations for selecting playlist
- Data select tool for exporting data
- Create app bar and remove frame
